# 🜂 Azt3kNet

Azt3kNet is a modular, AI-driven bot network orchestration platform built for simulation, research, and controlled automation. This repository blueprint outlines a scalable, production-ready architecture centered on asynchronous orchestration, clean APIs, and policy-aware automation.

> ⚠️ **Ethics & Safety:** Azt3kNet is intended for research and experimentation in sandboxed environments. Real-world deployment must respect platform terms of service, legal requirements, and ethical guidelines.

## ✨ Architectural Highlights
- **Asynchronous orchestration** for managing thousands of autonomous agents.
- **Pluggable content engine** supporting LLMs, templates, and scoring pipelines.
- **Compliance guardrails** enforcing policies before publication.
- **Simulation-first design** to test campaigns safely before integrations.
- **Extensible integrations** with mailbox and platform adapters.
- **Centralized configuration, logging, and auditing** for operational clarity.

For a full deep dive into the proposed system, see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🧩 Core Domains

| Module | Purpose | Key Technologies |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `orchestrator` | Coordinates agent lifecycles and workflows | `asyncio`, `Temporal`/`Celery`, `Pydantic` |
| `agent_factory` | Generates bots and manages metadata | `Faker`, `SQLAlchemy`, `pydantic` |
| `content_engine` | Draft generation, scoring, compliance pre-checks | `FastAPI`, `LangChain`, `transformers` |
| `scheduler` | Rate-limited publishing and approvals | `APScheduler`, `Redis`, `Arq`/`Celery` |
| `compliance_guard` | Policy enforcement and audit trails | `spaCy`, `OpenAI moderation`, `structlog` |
| `storage` | Unified persistence layer with repositories | `SQLAlchemy`, `Alembic`, S3-compatible blob storage |
| `simulation` | Feed and interaction sandbox for testing strategies | `asyncio`, `networkx`, `Mesa` |
| `integration` | External platform adapters & mailbox stubs | `HTTPX`, SDK-specific clients |

## 🚀 Minimum Viable Features
1. **Bot identity generation** with persistent metadata and bot templates.
2. **Content drafting pipeline** with scoring and compliance checks.
3. **Feed simulation** to rehearse campaigns safely.
4. **Rate-limited scheduler** for approval and publication workflows.
5. **Integration stubs** for mailbox management and external APIs.

## 🛠️ Tooling & Operations
- **Dependency management:** `poetry` with environment groups (api, worker, simulation, dev).
- **API service:** FastAPI with REST + WebSocket endpoints.
- **Task processing:** Celery/Arq workers powered by Redis or RabbitMQ.
- **Observability:** structlog + OpenTelemetry + Prometheus exporters.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for lint, type-check, test, and Docker image builds.
- **Local stack:** Docker Compose running Postgres, Redis, MinIO, and worker services.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
- `tests/unit`: Fast pytest suite with async fixtures and mocking of external providers.
- `tests/integration`: Spins up backing services via Docker for end-to-end flows.
- `tests/load`: Stress scenarios for orchestrator and scheduler.
- Optional contract tests for integration adapters and compliance pipelines.

## 🔮 Future Directions
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning for autonomous strategy adjustments.
- Operational dashboard (React/Next.js or Streamlit) consuming WebSocket event bus.
- Temporal.io or Prefect for long-running, resumable workflows.
- Federated storage strategies for large-scale deployments.
